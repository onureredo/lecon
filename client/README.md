# Frontend Roadmap for Social Media Application

This roadmap outlines the main development stages and focal points of a social media application. We'll be using Next.js, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS as our main technologies.

## 1. Project Setup

- Initialize a new Next.js project with TypeScript and TailwindCSS, a modern utility-first CSS framework that will allow us to design the UI with ease.
- Configure the necessary environment variables. These will include API endpoints, authentication tokens, and more.
- Install all necessary dependencies and set up linting and formatting tools such as ESLint and Prettier to maintain a clean and consistent codebase.

## 2. Types and Contexts

- Define clear and reusable TypeScript interfaces or types for models (User, Post, etc.) inside a dedicated `types` directory. This will ensure that we have a standardized way of referring to these entities throughout the application.
- Use React Context for global state management. This will primarily involve states related to user authentication and user data.

## 3. Component Development

- Begin component development with a mobile-first approach. This methodology is effective for creating responsive designs.
- Craft reusable components that will form the building blocks of the pages. These components may include UI elements like Buttons, Input Fields, Cards, and more.

## 4. Page Development

- Develop key pages for the application. This will likely include a Home Page, Profile Page, Post Detail Page, and more.
- Where appropriate, take advantage of Next.js's built-in features for server-side rendering or static generation to improve page load times and overall SEO.

## 5. Features Implementation

- Implement the authentication flow. This includes creating UIs and functionalities for signing up, signing in, and logging out.
- Work on post-related features. Users should be able to create, read, update, and delete posts.
- Implement social interaction features. These include liking, replying to, and reposting posts.
- Implement user following features. Users should be able to follow and unfollow each other.
- Implement support for mentions and hashtags in posts. This can be achieved using suitable libraries such as `react-mentions` and `react-linkify`.

## 6. Error Handling and Accessibility

- Develop a robust error handling mechanism to improve user experience.
- Keep accessibility in mind when designing and developing the application. This includes the proper use of ARIA attributes, ensuring good color contrast, adding descriptive alt text for images, and more.

## 7. Code Consistency and Organization

- Strive for consistency in casing, indentation style, and file naming throughout the project.
- Organize files and folders in a logical, maintainable way to make it easier for others to understand the project structure.

## 8. Documentation

- Comment code where necessary to provide context and clarity.

This roadmap provides a high-level overview of the development process. Each step encompasses significant work and may involve numerous subtasks. It's important to break down each step into smaller tasks as you progress to make the development process more manageable.

## Getting Started

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
