# Social Media Application - Frontend Development Overview

## Stack

- **Next.js**: Framework for server-side rendered React applications.
- **TypeScript**: Superset of JavaScript providing static typing, enhancing developer productivity.
- **TailwindCSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.

## Roadmap

### Project Initialization

1. **Create a New Next.js & TypeScript Project**: Initialize a new Next.js project configured with TypeScript. Use the `create-next-app` utility with the `--example with-typescript` option.
2. **Set Up TailwindCSS**: Install TailwindCSS and its dependencies and configure it to work with Next.js and PostCSS.

### Mobile-First Design and Development

3. **Plan the Layout**: Plan the design and layout of your application with a mobile-first approach. Start designing for smaller screens and then expand for larger ones.
4. **Implement Responsive Design**: Implement the responsive design using TailwindCSS classes. Remember to check the design on multiple screen sizes to ensure it works as expected.

### State Management and Cookies

5. **Create Authentication Context**: Use React's Context API to create a context for managing authentication.
6. **Manage Authentication State**: Store the authentication state (i.e., whether the user is logged in and their details) in your Authentication Context.
7. **Use Cookies**: To persist the authentication state across sessions, store the JWT token in HTTP-only cookies. This provides an added layer of security as HTTP-only cookies are not accessible via JavaScript, reducing the risk of XSS attacks.

## Types and Contexts

- Define clear and reusable TypeScript interfaces or types for models (User, Post, etc.) inside a dedicated `types` directory. This will ensure that we have a standardized way of referring to these entities throughout the application.
- Use React Context for global state management. This will primarily involve states related to user authentication and user data.

### Routing

8. **Implement Pages**: Next.js uses file-system-based routing. Implement your pages under the `pages/` directory. Dynamic routes can be handled using square bracket (`[]`) notation.

### Custom Hooks and Reusable Components

9. **Design Component Hierarchy**: Define a clear component hierarchy to manage UI components better.
10. **Create Custom Hooks**: Implement custom hooks for likes, reposts, and replies to encapsulate the business logic of these actions.
11. **Develop Reusable Components**: Create reusable components such as buttons, cards, forms, etc., to maintain UI consistency and simplify development.

### Testing and Deployment

12. **Component Testing**: Write tests for your components using Jest and React Testing Library to ensure they work as expected.
13. **End-to-End Testing**: Write end-to-end tests using Cypress to simulate user interactions and test the flow of your application.
14. **Deployment**: Finally, deploy your application using a platform like Vercel, which has built-in support for Next.js applications.

This roadmap offers a detailed view of the frontend development process. It's important to follow best practices for Next.js and TypeScript development, ensuring the code is clean, efficient, and maintainable.

## Getting Started

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
