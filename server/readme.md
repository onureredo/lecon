# Social Media Application - Backend Development Overview

This document outlines the process and tools used to develop the backend for our social media application.

## Stack

The project uses the following main technologies:

- **Node.js**: The JavaScript runtime that powers the server.
- **Express.js**: The web framework used to handle HTTP requests and responses.
- **MongoDB**: The database used to store and retrieve data.
- **Mongoose**: The Object Data Modeling (ODM) library used to interact with MongoDB and define schemas for our data.
- **Joi**: The library used for data validation.
- **JSON Web Tokens (JWTs)**: Used for authenticating users and securing endpoints.

## Development Process

### Project Initialization and Setup

- Initialized a new Node.js project.
- Set up an Express.js server.
- Connected to a MongoDB database using Mongoose.

### Model Definition

- Defined Mongoose schemas and models for `User` and `Post`.
- Incorporated data validation rules and established necessary relationships in these schemas.

### Middleware and Utility Functions

- Developed middleware functions to handle errors and protect routes.
- Created utility functions, such as the async handler and error response, to handle common operations.

### Authentication and Authorization

- Implemented user authentication using JWTs. This involved creating routes and controllers for user registration and login, as well as generating and verifying JWTs.
- Developed middleware to enforce authorization rules, ensuring that only authenticated users could access certain routes.

### Route Definitions

- Set up routes for user-related operations, including registration, login, following and unfollowing users, and retrieving user information.
- Created routes to handle post-related operations, including creating, reading, updating, and deleting posts.

### Controllers

- Developed controllers to manage the logic for each route, handling incoming requests and preparing responses.
- Incorporated error handling to provide meaningful feedback when operations failed.

### Data Validation with Joi

- Used Joi to define validation schemas for incoming data in request bodies.
- Applied these schemas to relevant routes to validate incoming requests.

### Testing

- Thoroughly tested all endpoints using the Insomnia tool, confirming the correct operation of all functionalities.

### Documentation

- Commented code as necessary for clarity and ease of maintenance.
- Maintained a current and detailed README file documenting project setup and progress.

This summary should provide a good understanding of the backend development process for this social media application project. Throughout the development, emphasis was placed on clean, maintainable code and following best practices for Node.js and Express.js development.
